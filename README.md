👋 Hi, I’m Hanaa!

👩‍💻 I'm a software engineer with a strong focus on backend development. I primarily work with the .NET ecosystem, including both legacy frameworks and modern platforms like .NET Core and the latest .NET versions (e.g., .NET 9). C# is my main programming language, and I've worked extensively with various ORM tools, especially with Microsoft SQL Server.

☁️ I've been developing cloud-based applications for quite some time, using services from major cloud providers like AWS and Azure. My main interest lies in continuing to design, build, and deliver scalable cloud-native applications.

🔍 I’m especially interested in collaborating on projects that utilize cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) and follow a microservices architecture.

📫 You can reach me out through [Email](hana2jebril@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hana2jebril/).

A bit more about me 🤓
I've been in software development for a long time—and the journey hasn't always been easy. Staying up to date with new features, tools, and frameworks is a constant part of my job. My work is primarily backend-focused using the Microsoft tech stack.

I prioritize maintainability, testability, and scalability in every solution I build. Writing clean, object-oriented code that performs well and adheres to best practices is a core part of my engineering philosophy.

🧩 Problem-solving is my favorite challenge. Every issue presents an opportunity to learn and improve, and I enjoy finding elegant solutions to tough technical problems. If there's one thing I'm sure of, it's that I’ll always go the extra mile to deliver the best possible results.
