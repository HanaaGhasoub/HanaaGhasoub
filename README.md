#### A little more about me :nerd_face:

Doing software development for a long time until now has not been easy. 
I should know about any updates, features, and specifications of the tools I am using. I mainly work on the backend using the Microsoft stack. 
Maintainability, testability, and scalability are the factors that lead me to create and develop clean code and object-oriented solutions with high performance and quality. 
Problem-solving is my favorite game. I always find new challenges when trying to find and solve problems. 
I am certain of one thing about myself, which is that I can do anything for the best outcome.
